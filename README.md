# Iris Flower Classifier – Multi-Model ML Project

## Project Overview
Predicts the species of an Iris flower (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`) using four features: **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.  

Implemented **multiple machine learning models** to compare performance and demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- **Samples:** 150  
- **Features:** 4 numeric features  
- **Target:** Species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes

## Results
**Best Model:** Random Forest  
**Accuracy:** 97–100%  

**Key Insights:**  
- Petal length and width are the most important features.  
- Setosa is easily separable, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly.
